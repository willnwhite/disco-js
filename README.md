# Index

Stuck? It's because you don't know something. Tell Index what you have, and what you want, and it will tell you what you need.

## Example
```javascript
// JavaScript
const words = [word1, word2, word3]
```
You want to know if the words in a list are all the same. You have an array, you want a true or false (a Boolean).

Tell Index "array in, Boolean out" and it will tell you the functions, methods and properties that can do that:

`find`, [`every`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/array/every), `includes`, `pop`, `reduce`, `reduceRight`, `shift`, `some`

```javascript
words.every(word => word === words[0])
```

Without finding `every`, you might have spent time replicating its functionality with a loop or `forEach`.
