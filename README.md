Stuck? It's because you don't know something. Tell Disco what you know, and Disco will tell you what you don't.

Example: You're trying to work out if the values in a list are all the same. You know you have a list (an array), and you know you want a yes/no answer (a Boolean).

The `every` method is the right tool for the job, but unless you know that already, you're going to spend time looking through the Array methods documentation. You might find `forEach` first, then spend time trying to replicate what `every` can already do. All because you didn't see that `every` returns a Boolean. Reading the manual can be so manual.

Disco is an index of JavaScript [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0) functions and methods by their return types. You say what you have, and what you want, and Disco tells you what you need.
